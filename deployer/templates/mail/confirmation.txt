Hello,

This email is a confirmation that your tournament has been created.

URL: http://{{tournament_name}}.nu-tab.com
Username: tab
Password: {{ password }}

Respond to this email if you would like me to change the password.

If you selected the option to add a test tournament, it will be available at the
url http://{{tournament_name}}-test.nu-tab.com, with the password "password".

Note: It could take an hour or two for the domain name to be configured. To
confirm that the server is working, try accesing it via its ip address:
http://{{ ip_address }}. If that does not work, respond to this email to let me
know.

Your server will stay alive for 4 weeks from now before it's deleted. If you need more
time, you can reply to this email to let me know. There are no back-ups once the
server is deleted! You will lose the results of the tournament.

Pro tip: You can you can import the teams, rooms, and judges in bulk with an
Excel file following these instructions https://github.com/jolynch/mit-tab#batch-data-import

Questions? Just respond to this email and I'll get back to you. My phone number
is 813-469-0382 if anything urgent comes up.

Best,
Ben
