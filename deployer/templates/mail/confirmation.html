<p>Hello,</p>

<p>This email is a confirmation that your tournament has been created.</p>

<p><strong>URL:</strong> <a href='{{ "http://{0}.nu-tab.com".format(tournament_name) }}'>{{ tournament_name }}.nu-tab.com</a></p>
<p><strong>Username:</strong> tab</p>
<p><strong>Password:</strong> {{ password }}</p>

<p>Note: This password cannot be changed manually. Email me if you wish to
change it.</p>

<p>If you selected the option to add a test tournament, it will be available at the
url http://{{tournament_name}}-test.nu-tab.com, with the password "password".</p>

<p>Note: It could take an hour or two for the domain name to be configured. To
confirm that the server is working, try accesing it via its ip address:
http://{{ ip_address }}. If that does not work, respond to this email to let me
know.</p>

<p>Questions? Try reading the <a href="https://github.com/jolynch/mit-tab/wiki">MIT-Tab Wiki</a>.
  It covers everything from importing data in bulk, pairing your round, and more.
</p>

<p>If anything isn't covered in the wiki, just respond to this email and I'll get back to you. My phone
number is 813-469-0382 if anything urgent comes up.</p>

<p>Best,</p>
<p>Ben</p>
